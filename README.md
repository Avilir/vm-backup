    This is a fork of NAUbackup/VmBackup.py that was originly developed by
    The Northern Arizona University at 2019

    The Intention of this fork is to make this script python3 compatible,
    run from client which is not the Xen-Server and also containarized.

## Version History (of This fork):
 - v0.01 2023/05/05 Initial version running on python3.

Author: Avi Liani - <avi@liani.co.il>

**DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT UNLESS YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THESE ACTIONS.**
 
- For vm-export: (a) `xe vm-snapshot`, (b) `xe template-param-set`, (c) `xe vm-export`, (d) `xe vm-uninstall` on the vm-snapshot.
- For vdi-export: (a) `xe vdi-snapshot`, (b) `xe vdi-param-set`, (c) `xe vdi-export`, (d) `xe vdi-destroy` on the vdi-snapshot.

## Overview
 - The vmbackup.py script is run on a XenServer host (via ssh) and utilizes the native `xe vm-export` and `xe vdi-export` commands to backup both Linux and Windows VMs. 
 - The vm-export or vdi-export is run after a respective vm-snapshot or vdi-snapshot occurs, which allows for the export to execute while the VM is up and running.
 - These backup command techniques were originally discovered from anonymous Internet sources, then modified and developed into this python code. The new vdi-export feature was developed from information found at http://wiki.xensource.com/wiki/Disk_import/export_APIs
 - During the backup of specified VMs, this script collects additional VM metadata using the XenServer XenAPI. This additional information can be useful during VM restore situations and is stored in each individual VM backup location.
 - Typically, vmbackup.py is implemented through scheduled crontab entries or can be run manually on a XenServer ssh session. It is important to keep in mind that the backup process does use critical DOM0 resources, so running a backup during heavy workloads should be avoided.
 - The SRs where one or more VDIs are located require sufficient free space to hold a complete snapshot of a VM. The temporary snapshots that are created during the backup process are deleted after the vm-export has completed.
 - If the config-file pool_db_backup=1 is specified, then the pool state backup occurs via the `xe pool-dump-database` command. 
 - Optionally, a completion status email can be sent by configuring VmBackup.py variables that are provided in the code, see the Quick Start Checklist section.


## Release 0.01 Summary

 - python3 compatibility.

## Quick Start Checklist

After cloning this repo. install all requirements module by running :

    pip install -r requierments.txt 

1. vmbackup will require lots of file storage. Set up a storage server with an exported VM backup share. By default, VmBackup.py uses /snapshots, which can be modified. Frequently NFS is used for the storage server, with many installation and configuration sources available on the web. An optional SMB/CIFS method can be enabled through comments in the script.
2. For all the XenServers in a given pool, mount the new /snapshots share. 
3. Finish creating a share directory structure that meets your needs. Here are the VmBackup.py default subdirectories which can be changed:
   - /snapshots/BACKUPS - this is for all VM backups
   - /snapshots/NAUbackup - this is for the VmBackup.py script, any config files, and the status.log summary file.
   - /snapshots/NAUbackup/logs - this is for redirecting your cronjob VmBackup.py output.
4. Download VmBackup.py, example.cfg, README.md to your execution location, such as /snapshots/NAUbackup
5. Inspect and customize the comments in page one of the VmBackup.py code. Here are some of the changes you may want to configure:
 - Find text HARD CODED DEFAULTS - these values are in effect anytime you run VmBackup.py with a command line vm-selector. Many of these code defaults can also be overridden in the config-file.
 - Find text OPTIONAL - if you want an automatic email to be sent at end of VmBackup then follow the instructions for the label MAIL_ENABLE. 
6. Install the XenServer Software Development Kit from www.citrix.com/downloads - download the XenServer and copy file XenAPI.py into the same directory where VmBackup.py exists.
   - To verfy XenApi, execute VmBackup with a valid password and some simple vm-name.
   - Example: ./VmBackup.py password vm-name preview 
   - Note: if password has any special characters, then escape with back slash: ./VmBackup.py pass\$word vm-name
7. Follow some VmBackup usage examples in the next section and try some examples with your VMs. Initially use the `preview` option, followed by a non-preview execution to actually see the VM export process. If you have a test XenServer environment, then utilize this for test verification. Note that if multiple definitions of VMs and/or VDIs are put into the configuration file, the last valid definition will take precedence over any earlier detected definitions. In addition, excludes will take precedence over any backup definitions.
8. VM Recovery testing is an important part of the setup, see later section. Become familiar with the /snapshots/BACKUPS/vm-name directory structure and file contents, also in later section. After backing up some VMs then restore them on a test system and verify VM functionality.
9. Plan your backup strategy, such as weekly, bi-monthly, monthly frequencies. How many copies of each backup do you want to keep? How long do your backup configurations take to execute and does this fit in with your XenServer processing priorities?
10. Execute your plan which typically involves setting up a XenServer crontab schedule, see later section.

## Usage Examples

### vmbackup.py Command Usage

#### Basic usage:

	./vmbackup.py
	
	Usage:
	./VmBackup.py  <password> <config-file|vm-selector> [preview] [other optional params]
	
	Also: VmBackup.py help    - for additional parameter usage
	  or: VmBackup.py config  - for config-file parameter usage
	  or: VmBackup.py example - for some simple example usage




 
## Note:
The API calls to retrieve VM name-labels (such as "session.xenapi.VM.get_by_name_label") will also pull in those of all available VM templates. Hence, do not name any VM the same as any template or there will be a conflict with this utility! 

### Important Details About Python REGEX Syntax and Configuration File Differences

Handling of wildcard VMs has been expanded to incorporate the native python regex library of regular expressions. WARNING: The syntax is slightly different from what is processed with the Linux family of grep commands. Note in particular that the earlier wildcard prefix option in V3.0 using a single trailing asterisk "\*" will behave _differently_ under V3.1 and hence any older scripts should have such occurences changed instead to ".\*" to retain the same behavior! Failing to do so may result in unexpected results. This is because in python, a string followed by "*" causes the resulting regular expression to match zero or more repetitions of the preceding regular expression, as many repetitions as are possible. For example, ab* will match "a", "ab", or "a" followed by any number of "b" characters. Therefore, if you had PRD-a* before, this will now match PRD-a, PRD-aa, PRD-aaaSomething, as well as PRD- but _also_ PRD-Test, PRD-123 and anything else starting with PRD- since zero occurences of the "a" after the "-" are matched. To avoid this, PRD-a.* should be used, instead, indicating in this case PRD-a followed by any single character (".") zero or more("*") times.

Note that the current implementation uses the re.match function which by design is expected to be front-anachored. You can explicitly preface a search string with the "^" operator, if desired, but it is already implied and the results will be the same.

A VM name is considered to be a simple (non-wildcard) name, provided that it contains only combinations of any of the following: letters (upper as well as lower case), numerals 0 through 9, the space charachter, hyphens (dashes), and underscore characters. These will _no_t be handled using regex operations!

Here are some examples of regex selections. Note that if a vdi-export definition is encouteded in the configuration file before a matching vm-export definition, the vdi-export will take precedence. Recall also that exclude definitions must appear first in the script before any VDI or VM definitions and will be appled to all vdi-export and vm-export rules.

	# exclude simple host names (non-wildcard instances)
	exclude=DEV-phishing-test
	exclude=PRD-PRINTER1

	# exclude using end-of-string - handled as a regex expression
	exclude=PRD-PRINT$

	# exclude PRD-a as well as PRD-a followed by anything (note the use of ".*" instead of "*")
	exclude=PRD-a.*

	# exclude DEV-V followed by anything followed by TEMP and anding in TEMP (end-of-string)
	exclude=DEV-V.*TEMP$

	# back up just the root VDI of DEV-web3
	vdi-export=DEV-web3

	# the same as above, except retain seven copies
	vdi-export=DEV-web3:7

	# back up just the root VDI for anything strting with DEV followed by anything, followed
	# by either the string "TEST" or the string "test" followed by anything else
	vdi-export=DEV-.*(TEST|test).*

	# The same as above, except using the string "Test" or "test"
	vdi-export=DEV-.*[Tt]est.*

	# back up VMs ending with the string SAVE and keeping five versions
	vm-export=.*SAVE$:5

	# back up VMs starting with PRD- and ending with print4 or print5 and save five versions
	vm-export=PRD-.*print[4-5]$:5

	# back up VMs starting with PRD- and ending with print6, print7 or print8 and save ten versions
	vm-export=PRD-.*print[6-8]$:10

	# back up VMs starting with PRD- and ending with print followed by any number(s) and ending
	# in that same string of numbers and save eight versions
	vm-export=PRD-.*print[\d{1,}]$:8

Note that there are numerous combinations that may possily conflict with each other or potentially overlap. It is strongly encouraged to use the "preview" option to review the configuration output before putting into service.


### Python REGEX Syntax Errors

In the event of a regex error, the script will deliberately fail as otherwise, results may be unpredictable and/or undesirabrle. Regex errors will be shown when using the preview option, and it is recommended to check the syntax ahead of implementing any scripts into actual use. For example, if instead of vm-export=PRD-[aA].* you had created a line reading vm-export=PRD-[aA.* (with a missing square bracket), the resulting error message would include output similar to this:

2016-11-03-(12:34:02) - ***ERROR - invalid regex: vm-export=PRD-[aA.*
.
.
.
2016-11-03-(12:34:04) - ERROR regex errors found (see above)  - WARNINGS found (see above)

You should then correct any such errors. Because of the rich number of options available, typos still can be interperted as perfectly valid regex syntax, hence again, a preview of the results is stronly encouraged. A good source on python regex syntax can be found at: https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html


### Common cronjob Example

Typically you will want to run the cron with an input config file and redirected output file in case any run time errors occur.

	10 0 * * 6 /usr/bin/python /snapshots/NAUbackup/VmBackup.py password \
	/snapshots/NAUbackup/example.cfg >> /snapshots/NAUbackup/logs/VmBackup.log 2>&1

Provide the password for the user `root`. If it contains special characters, make sure to set it in single quotes, e.g. `'your*Password'`.

### VM selection and max_backups operations

The vm-export and vdi-export each have an associated process list where each entry is of the form vm-name:max_backups. The :max_backups is optional, and if specified then is the maximum number of backups to maintain for this vm-name. Otherwise, the global max_backups is in effect for the given vm-name. At the completion of every successful VM vm-export/vdi-operation, the oldest backup(s) are deleted using the in effect vm-name:max_backups value.

The following VM selection operations apply to both the vm-export and vdi-export; (1) load all single vm-name:max_backups with no wildcard into the associated process list, (2) for any VM-regex:max_backups, query the XenServer and load each applicable vm-name into the associated process list and do not replace the VMs from step 1, then finally (3) remove any excluded VMs (both simple and regex-based) from the process list VMs. By using the `preview` option then the scope of the given VmBackup run is clearly defined.

For any individual VmBackup.py run, then any single VM should preferably not be in both vm-export and vdi-export process lists, otherwise confusion or a potential error could occur; a VM found in a vdi-export list will take precedence over a matching entry in a vm-export list. The convention is that a VM is backed up with a vm-export or a vdi-export, but not both. If at some point in time a VM grows in number of /dev/xvdX disks where it is required to switch from vm-export to vdi-export, then the same /snapshots/BACKUPS/vm-name structure continues. Since in this case the backups are ordered by date with a mix of vdi-export and older vm-export backups, then eventually the vm-export backups will be deleted. One technique to save any of the older vm-exports from automatically deleting is to simply rename /snapshots/BACKSUPS/vm-name to /snapshots/BACKSUPS/vm-name_xva at time of the conversion to vdi-export.
 

### VM Backup Directory Structure

The VM backup directory has this format %BACKUP_DIR%/vm-name/date-time/ and each VM backup directory contains the VM backup file plus additional VM metadata, including with V3.22 a full XML dump of the VM metadata. 

Each successful backup directory is marked by a touched file of `success` and in some special cases may include `success_other-actions`. These situations may be reviewed in the VmBackup code.

The number of VM backups saved is based upon the config max_backups value. For example, if max_backups=3 and when the forth successful backup completes, then the oldest backup directory date-time will be deleted.

As each new VM backup begins, then a check is made to ensure that the last VM backup was successful. If it was not successful then the previous failed backup directory will be deleted.

#### VM Backup File Types
The vm backup file has one of three possible formats, (a) vm-name.vxa which is created from a vm-export command, (b) vm-name.raw which is created from vdi-export and vdi-export-form=raw, or (c) vm-name.vhd which is created from vdi-export and vdi-export-form=vhd.

#### Additional VM Metadata
For each backup directory, there is a dump of selected XenServer VM metadata. This information can be useful in certain recovery situations.

* vm.cfg - includes name_label, name_description, memory_dynamic_max, VCPUs_max, VCPUs_at_startup, os_version, orig_uuid
* DISK-xvda (for each attached disk)
	* vbd.cfg - includes userdevice, bootable, mode, type, unplugable, empty, orig_uuid
	* vdi.cfg - includes name_label, name_description, virtual_size, type, sharable, read_only, orig_uuid, orig_sr_uuid 
* VIFs (for each attached VIF)
  * vif-0.cfg - includes device, network_name_label, MTU, MAC, other_config, orig_uuid


## Restore
### VM Restore from the vm-export backup
Use the `xe vm-import` command. See `xe help vm-import` for parameter options. In particular, attention should be paid to the "preserve" option, which if specified as `preserve=true` will re-create as many of the original settings as possible, such as the associated VM UUID values along with the network and MAC addresses.

### VDI Restore from the vdi-export backup
Use the `xe vdi-import` command. See `xe help vdi-import` for parameter options. However, the current Citrix documentation is lacking and the best vdi-import examples can be found at http://wiki.xensource.com/wiki/Disk_import/export_APIs

**For each Xenserver installation where the choice is made to use the vdi-export backup mechanism, then it is imperative that you test a VM restore procedure for your specific Xenserver VM envirionment**

An outline of what has worked for us is provided:

1. Create a new VM with no attached virtual disks. This can be obtained a number of ways. One method is to restore another VM of the exact same OS version as the candidate VM you need to restore and remove all virtual disks that from the new VM you have just restored. Also review and set the VM memory, cpu, and network requirements.
2. Create a new VDI with the same size as the original /dev/xvda boot disk. The size can be found in the %BACKUP_DIR%/vm-name/date-time/DISK-xvda/vdi.cfg virtual_size=xxxxxxxx value.
	- NEW_VDI_UUID=$(xe vdi-create name-label=your-name sr-uuid=your-sr-uuid type=system virtual-size=xxxxxxxx)
	- echo $NEW_VDI_UUID
3. Restore from your vdi-export file which will either be format=raw or format=vhd. For the following example we use a raw vdi-export.
	- xe vdi-import uuid=$NEW_VDI_UUID filename=path-of-your-vdi-backup.raw format=raw
	- If any error messages then analyze the issue.
4. From XenCenter attach the new restored VDI to the new candidate VM and try to boot the VM up. **Note if the original VM were production and still live, then you will need to beware that this new VM may intefere with the production VM network availability, so take the necessary precautions that this restore does not cause a VM network conflict.**

### Pool Restore from the config pool_db_backup=1
If config pool_db_backup=1 has been specified then a %BACKUP_DIR%/METADATA_host-name/pool_db_date-time.dump file will be created.

In the situation where the pool is corrupt and no hosts will start in the pool then it may be necessary to restore and rebuild the XenServer pool. **This decision should be carefully reviewed with advice from Citrix Support.** Consult the Citrix XenServer Administrator's Guide chapter 8 and review sections that discuss the `xe pool-restore-database` command.

### Example of setting up an NFS export on a Linux server for VmBacku

Note that there may be slight variations here, depending on the exact O
and OS version of the NFS Linux server being used

Create a subdirectory on your XenServers, for example: /snapshot

This can also be additional layers deep, such as /snapshots/xspool
or whatever name you wish, as long as you properly set the permission
correctly and down through all layers

Permissions should be set to 755 (drwxr-xr-x) by running this comman
(substitute in your own directory and subdirectory, of course)

chmod 755 /snapshot

and it should be owned in this case by root and can be checked if you run
ls -l /snapshot

drwxr-xr-x 9 root root 4096 Sep 17 08:10 /snapshots

The export permissions should be set in the NFS server's /etc/export
file as follows, making sure there is an entry for every XenServe
that needs to be able to access the NFS share, for example

/snapshots 10.11.12.10(rw,sync,no_root_squash
/snapshots 10.11.12.11(rw,sync,no_root_squash
/snapshots 10.11.12.12(rw,sync,no_root_squash

On the NFS server, run "exportfs -a" to update the list of NFS exports

On each of the XenServer hosts, create a corresponding subdirectory
(which can be different from what is exported from the NFS server -- that's
up to you) and add a mount point entry in /etc/fstab with in this case
the NFS server having the IP address of 192.168.120.200 which might b
set up via a VLAN or a dedicated NIC that was assigned that address
(and make sure this is edited in as a single line)

192.168.120.200:/snapshots /snapshots/xspool2 nfs rw,tcp,soft,intr,nfsvers=3
rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576  0 

The directories should all also be owned by root:root and have the same 75
permissions as with the subdirectory defined on the NFS server side
Note that if not specified, the rsize/wsize will default to whatever you
server has defined, but in many cases, performance can be improved b
increasing those buffer sizes well beyond what might be typical, lik
32k or 64k. Also, not that the NFS version will depend on which versio
of NFS you are running both on your NFS server as well as which versio
of XenServer you are running. It will fall back to whatever is the default
if you leave out the "nfsvers=N" entry altogether

At this point, you can verify the share can be seen by your XenServer host

showmount -e 192.168.120.20

which should give you an export list that includes your XenServer(s)

Finally, a "mount -a" command should mount the NFS area and a "df" command
should show it visible on each of your XenServers

Make sure to update the NFS mount point definition in any VmBackup
configuration (.cfg) file(s) you make use of if you do not use the default
settings. For example, to match the above configuration, you could override
the default by adding the line

backup_dir='/snapshots/xspool2

Note that the default is set in the VmBackup.py file itself

DEFAULT_BACKUP_DIR = '/snapshots/BACKUPS
